## What is `setup.py`?

The setup.py file is at the heart of a Python project. It describes all the metadata about your project. There are quite a few fields you can add to a project to give it a rich set of metadata describing the project. However, there are only three required fields: name, version, and packages. - Taken from [Python Setup.py - Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/setup-py)

Copilet's says it's a script that automates the installation of a Python package. It is also used to create a source distribution and a binary distribution. `setup.py` is the traditional way of defining a package. `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml` are the new ways of defining a package.
